- 👋 Hi, I’m @LudaToTheChris
- 👀 I’m interested in Service provider networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Ruby and Perl
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating open-source specialize testing software for independent service provider engineers. I'm looking to work with beginners in 
      programming because this is a journey I want to enjoy and develop with others!
